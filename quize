Question 3:
Material comes in different widths.  We have material in 36 inch and 60 inch widths.

Using material that's 36 inches wide, our dress pattern needs a length of 150 inches.  
It only needs 80 inches of material that's 60 inches wide.

Which of these conditions will correctly work out if we have enough material to make a dress?
